# General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointers.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
# 0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name.

Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));
# 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
where size is the size of the array
and action is a pointer to the function you need to use
# 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer.

Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
where size is the number of elements in the array array
cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
If no element matches, return -1
If size <= 0, return -1
# 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple operations.

You are allowed to use the standard library
Usage: calc num1 operator num2
You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int
operator is one of the following:
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line
You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int
if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98
if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99
if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100
This task requires that you create four different files.

3-calc.h

This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. You can use this structure:
# 4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

Usage: ./main number_of_bytes
Output format:
the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
each opcode is two char long
listing ends with a new line
see example
You are allowed to use printf and atoi
You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int
If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2
You do not have to compile with any flags
Note: if you want to translate your opcodes to assembly instructions, you can use, for instance udcli.
